## 🔐 Roles & Permissions

### Role Determination
Roles are determined by `DepartmentID`:
- **DepartmentID = 10** → HR (ultimate authority)
- **DepartmentID = 11** → Board (ultimate authority)
- **EmployeeRole = Manager** → Manager (team authority)
- **Default** → Employee

### Role-Based Access

#### Board
- Dashboard with filters, stats, and charts
- History of all requests
- HR Requests view
- Profile management

#### HR (Admin)
- Dashboard with filters, stats, and charts
- My Requests (personal)
- Staff Requests (all employees)
- Employee List (add/edit/soft delete)
- **Override Authority**: Can approve/reject any request at any time
- Profile management

#### Manager
- Profile management
- My Requests (personal)
- My Staff Requests (team members)
- Leave Balance Report (dynamic)
- Can approve/reject team requests

#### Employee
- Profile management
- My Requests (editable while Pending)
- Leave Balance Report (dynamic, cannot see past dates)

## 🔄 Request Flow State Machine

### Status Flow
```
Pending (1)
├─ Employee can EDIT
├─ Employee can CANCEL
├─ Manager can APPROVE → Pending HR (2)
├─ Manager can REJECT → Rejected by Manager (4) [FINAL]
└─ HR/Board can APPROVE → Approved by HR (3) [FINAL]
   └─ HR/Board can REJECT → Rejected by HR (5) [FINAL]

Pending HR (2)
├─ Employee CANNOT edit
├─ Employee can CANCEL (until HR decision)
├─ HR can APPROVE → Approved by HR (3) [FINAL]
└─ HR can REJECT → Rejected by HR (5) [FINAL]

Final Statuses:
- Approved by HR (3)
- Rejected by Manager (4)
- Rejected by HR (5)
- Cancelled by Employee (6)
```

### Edit & Cancel Rules
- **Can Edit**: Only while status = Pending (1) and only by request owner
- **Can Cancel**: While Pending (1) or Pending HR (2), before final decision, only by request owner
- **Cannot Edit/Cancel**: After final decision (statuses 3, 4, 5, 6)

### HR Override
- HR can approve/reject ANY request at ANY time (except final statuses)
- HR decision overrides Manager decisions
- Once HR decides → Status becomes FINAL

## 📊 Leave Balance Calculation

### Formula
```
LeaveDaysUsed = Unit × Sign × (EndDate - StartDate).Days
```

### Parameters
- **Unit**: 
  - 1 = Full day
  - 0.5 = Half day
  - 0.25 = Quarter day
- **Sign**:
  - +1 = Addition (e.g., bonus leave)
  - -1 = Deduction (e.g., leave taken)
  - 0 = Neutral (e.g., sick leave)

### Employee Levels
- **Level A**: 15 days/year
- **Level B**: 24 days/year

### Accrual Rules
- **Monthly Accrual**: Total Annual Leave / 12
- **Probation Period**: No accrual for first 6 months
- **Carryover**: Can carry forward leave to next year once
- **Expiration**: Remaining leave after following year expires

### Dynamic Calculation
Leave balance is calculated dynamically based on:
1. Date of employment
2. Months of service (excluding probation)
3. Employee level entitlement
4. Approved leave transactions
5. Current date or specified "as of" date

## 📈 Dashboard & Charts

### Board & HR Dashboards
- **Bar Chart**: Requests per Department/Employee
- **Pie Chart**: Distribution by Department/Employee
- **Filters**: Status, Department, Employee, Date Range
- **Group By**: Department or Employee
- **Stats**: Total, Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled

### Employee Dashboard
- Shows only personal requests
- Filters apply to own requests
- Charts show personal stats
- No department grouping

### Manager Dashboard
- Shows team requests
- Filters apply to team members
- Grouping by Employee or Department
- Team statistics
